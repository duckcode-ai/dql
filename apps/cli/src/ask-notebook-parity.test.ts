/**
 * Ask ↔ Notebook execution parity.
 *
 * The reported bug: "the SQL Ask generated fails in Ask, but the same text runs
 * fine when I paste it into a notebook cell."
 *
 * It was true. `POST /api/query` ran the statement verbatim, while the Ask lane
 * re-qualified relations, regex-parameterized the WHERE clause, round-tripped
 * the whole thing through the DQL block compiler, and finally wrapped it as
 * `SELECT * FROM (<sql>) AS dql_agent_preview LIMIT 200`. Five rewrites, each
 * able to fail on SQL the warehouse would have accepted.
 *
 * This harness pins the contract: for the same input SQL, both surfaces send
 * the warehouse the same statement (Ask may append a row bound, and only that),
 * and return the same columns and rows.
