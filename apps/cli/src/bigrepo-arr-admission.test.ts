/**
 * The big-repo admission regression.
 *
 * Nineteen recorded runs of "top 10 customer accounts by net arr" against a
 * 3,373-model warehouse all ended blocked, and every one failed the same way:
 * the host retrieved the relations that could answer the question, then showed
 * the analyst a support report, a forecast table and a single column card
 * instead. With no relation and no column vocabulary the model invented
 * `customer_account_name`, every tier refused the invention, and the turn spent
 * its remaining budget re-guessing.
 *
 * These assertions are about the WORKSPACE, not about a model: what retrieval
 * admits, whether an admitted relation carries the columns a query needs, and
 * whether those columns are legal identifiers. No warehouse and no rows are
 * required to answer that, which is why this fixture has neither.
