 * The office golden lane: the same harness over `test/fixtures/office-golden`,

 * blocks, where the competitor lives in a different table (SFDC.OPPORTUNITY)
 * from the amounts (SALES.OPPORTUNITY_ENHANCED), reps tag competitors in
 * SALESLOFT.OPPORTUNITIES.TAGS, and the fiscal year starts on February 1.
 * It carries the office question verbatim. Selecting the fixture is an
 * environment variable read at module load, so this file sets it and imports
 * the harness.
