/**
 * The tools the analyst loop may call.
 *
 * `buildAnswerLoopTools` carries the host's catalog tools, but NOT the governed
 * semantic ones — so a loop given only those could search metadata and validate
 * SQL, yet never compile a governed query. `compile_semantic_query` is the IR:
 * metrics + dimensions + grain + filters in, dialect SQL or a typed refusal out.
 * It is also the only path whose output the pipeline will label governed, since
 * it validates every member against the layer instead of trusting the model.
 *
 * Extracted from the provider seam so the tool surface is assertable directly;
 * it is the loop's entire view of what it can do, and a silently missing tool
 * degrades answers rather than failing loudly.
