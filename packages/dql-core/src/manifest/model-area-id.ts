 * The local id of a model area, given either the qualified
 * `<domain>::model_area::<localId>` form or the local form.
 *
 * Four server call sites and one UI call site used to split on `'::area::'`,
 * which never matches the real separator, so `.at(-1)` handed back the entire
 * qualified id. Passed on as an `areaId`, that reached the authoring layer's
 * safe-id regex — which rejects `:` — and failed the whole proposal. Binding a
 * dbt model whose `relationships` test pointed at an already-area-owned entity
 * was unreachable as a result. Everything that needs a local id comes here.
 *
 * Takes the last `::` segment rather than slicing after the marker: a local id
 * can never contain `::` (the safe-id charset excludes `:`), so the final
 * segment is always the local id, and an unexpectedly-shaped input still yields
 * something writable instead of a value that fails validation downstream.
