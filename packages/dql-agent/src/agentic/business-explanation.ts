/**
 * Answering "what does this mean?" from governed metadata, without SQL.

 * A definitional question — "what does the top_customers block measure?", "how
 * is revenue defined here?" — is routed to `converse` today, which replies
 * conversationally with NO governed evidence attached. So the product knows the
 * answer (it has the description, the owner, the grain, the outputs, the
 * certification status) and does not use it, which is the shape of the
 * complaint that Ask AI cannot explain business context.
 *
 * This composes the explanation deterministically from what the catalog already
 * holds. No provider, no warehouse: the facts are all in the object, and a model
 * paraphrasing them can only add drift.
