/**
 * The join-fanout proof for a NATIVE semantic query.
 *
 * MetricFlow and dbt Cloud own their join semantics; the native composer does
 * not. When it joins several models it can multiply fact rows, and an
 * aggregate over multiplied rows is the worst kind of wrong: a confident,
 * governed-looking number. The composer therefore hands back an unfiltered
 * probe (`base_rows` vs `joined_rows`) and the host runs it BEFORE the
 * governed query. `joined_rows > base_rows` is proof the join key is not
 * unique on the joined side; nothing is shown in that case.
 *
 * These codes deliberately carry no adapter/warehouse error text: that text
 * can contain credentials, SQL literals, or other operator-only detail.
