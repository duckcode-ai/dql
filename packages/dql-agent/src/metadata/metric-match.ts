/**
 * Semantic-metric matching (spec 17, part C).
 *
 * The answer-loop already has a `semantic_layer` tier in its route order
 * (certified → business_context → semantic_layer → dbt_manifest → generated →
 * refuse). The miss it fixes here: matching a clear metric question to a governed
 * metric was purely string-based (FTS token overlap), so "what is our total
 * revenue" did not connect to a revenue-family metric like `cumulative_revenue`,
 * `food_revenue`, or `lifetime_spend` — no metric is literally named "revenue" —
 * and the loop refused instead of routing to the semantic tier.
 *
 * `matchSemanticMetric` ranks candidate metric KG nodes against the question
 * using:
 *   - a synonym/family expansion of the question's measure terms (revenue ⇄
 *     spend/sales/income/arr; orders ⇄ purchases; ...), and of each metric's
 *     searchable text (name + synonyms + label + description + tags),
 *   - lexical token overlap blended through the spec-11 `hybridRank`
 *     (small non-zero alpha by default when lexical signal exists),
 *   - a strong boost when a measure FAMILY (e.g. "revenue") is shared between
 *     the question and the metric, which is what makes "total revenue" reach the
 *     revenue family even though the exact word never appears in a metric name.
 *
 * It returns the single best metric only when the score clears a confidence
 * threshold, so genuinely ad-hoc questions ("median order value by region")
 * still fall through to generated SQL, and questions with no measure at all
 * still refuse honestly.
