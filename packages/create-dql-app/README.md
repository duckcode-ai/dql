# create-dql-app

The fastest way to start a DQL project.

```bash
npx create-dql-app@latest my-analytics
cd my-analytics
npm install
npm install --prefix .dql/connectors duckdb       # DuckDB/local files only
# npm install --prefix .dql/connectors snowflake-sdk  # Snowflake only
# Databricks does not need an extra package.
npm run notebook
```

Opens a running notebook at <http://127.0.0.1:3474> in under 5 minutes on a
clean machine. No global install required; the template installs
`@duckcodeailabs/dql-cli` locally and exposes it through npm scripts.

The scaffolded project is a clean starter: `dql.config.json`, a welcome
notebook, and npm scripts for `notebook`, `compile`, `lineage`, `doctor`, and
`validate`. If a sibling dbt project is detected, it is wired into
`dql.config.json` automatically so `dql sync dbt` works out of the box.

Database drivers are project-local so the base install stays fast:

| Database | Extra install | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Databricks SQL | none | Built into DQL through HTTPS |
| DuckDB or local files | `npm install --prefix .dql/connectors duckdb` | Needed for DuckDB, CSV, Parquet, and JSON |
| Snowflake | `npm install --prefix .dql/connectors snowflake-sdk` | Needed for Snowflake connections |

You can also install DuckDB or Snowflake from the notebook Connections page.

Want a ready-made dbt project to try DQL on? Clone the example repo and add
DQL to it — the same steps you'd use on your own dbt repo:
[github.com/duckcode-ai/jaffle-shop-duckdb](https://github.com/duckcode-ai/jaffle-shop-duckdb).

Already installed `@duckcodeailabs/dql-cli` globally? That only installs the
command. From an existing dbt repo, run `dql init ./dql` before `cd dql`.
