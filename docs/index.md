# DQL

> **Bringing dbt's discipline to the analytics layer — built on top of dbt.**

dbt governs your models; the *answers* built on them — the query behind a
dashboard tile, the metric pasted into Slack, the SQL an AI assistant just
improvised against your warehouse — usually aren't reviewed, tested, or owned.
DQL carries that same discipline downstream: every answer becomes a
**certified block** (SQL + owner, domain, tests, chart intent, and LLM
context) in a git-tracked `.dql` file. Apps package certified blocks into
decision-facing dashboard pages and notebooks. `dql compile` generates a
dbt-like manifest with lineage from sources and dbt models through blocks and
Apps — and the agent/MCP server answers from certified blocks first, flagging
anything improvised as *Uncertified*.

No hosted account is required. Certification is a local trust label. Personas
and policies are local previews, not hosted RBAC.

## Start Here

From your dbt repo:

```bash
dbt parse                        # ensure target/manifest.json exists
npx create-dql-app@latest dql    # scaffolds ./dql, auto-wires dbt
cd dql
npm install
npm run sync                     # import dbt models + lineage
npm run notebook                 # http://127.0.0.1:3474

# Optional, only before running queries with these drivers:
# npm install --prefix .dql/connectors duckdb        # DuckDB/local files
# npm install --prefix .dql/connectors snowflake-sdk # Snowflake
# Databricks does not need an extra package.
```

If you installed `@duckcodeailabs/dql-cli` globally, initialize the project
folder first:

```bash
cd your-dbt-repo
dql init ./dql
cd dql
dql doctor
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run compile
npm run lineage
```

## Why DQL

- **Certified blocks.** Save reusable answer units with metadata, tests, and
  local trust status.
- **Apps in git.** Package dashboard pages, notebooks, text, AI pins, and draft
  blocks in local App folders.
- **dbt-aware lineage.** Connect sources, dbt models, semantic metrics, DQL
  blocks, dashboard pages, and Apps in `dql-manifest.json`.
- **Agent-safe defaults.** Local agent and MCP tools prefer certified blocks and
  label fallback generated SQL as uncertified.
- **OSS boundary clarity.** Local single-user workflows are open source; hosted
  auth, managed secrets, audit logs, organization RBAC, and approval workflows
  are outside OSS.
