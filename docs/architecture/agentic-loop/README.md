# The DQL Agentic Analyst Loop

> How DQL turns a natural-language question into a **governed, grounded, trustworthy** answer —
> and how it searches, uses tools, evaluates, self-corrects, and learns over time.

This folder is the reference for the whole agentic architecture. Start here for the high-level
picture, then follow the links into each concern.

## The thesis in one line

**DQL is a *tiered governed analyst loop*: a Reflexion-style outer supervisor (plan → gate →
repair/escalate) whose executors are grounded in a governed semantic layer, with a
learn-from-experience memory — never a raw text-to-SQL guess, never an auto-certified answer.**

The moat is not "an LLM that writes SQL." It is the **governance scaffolding around it**: certified
blocks, a knowledge graph over dbt + DQL, execution-guided gates, an honest trust ladder, and a
scope-gated learning loop.

**Reading it:** a question is *classified* (no LLM), *planned* into 1–N steps, and each step *routes*
to an executor. Certified matches short-circuit to a fast one-shot answer; everything else is
**grounded** (search the graph, link the schema), **planned** (state grain + joins before SQL),
**executed**, and **gated**. A gate failure drives a bounded **repair** (same route, corrected) or an
**escalation** (a different route). The result carries an **honest trust label**. When a human
certifies or corrects it, the **governed delta** is captured and retrieved on the next similar
question — the loop learns.

## The trust ladder (the governing invariant)

Every answer lands on exactly one rung. **AI never auto-promotes to `certified`** — that is always
a human act.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    B["🚫 blocked<br/>can't ground it"] --> R["📝 review_required<br/>generated, unverified"]
    R --> G["🛡️ grounded / 'verified'<br/>executed cleanly on real data"]
    G ==>|"human certifies"| C["✅ certified<br/>governed metric"]
    NA["➖ not_applicable<br/>clarify / no data question"]

    classDef human fill:#fef9c3,stroke:#ca8a04;
    linkStyle 2 stroke:#ca8a04,stroke-width:2px;
```

See [Evaluation & trust](./05-evaluation-and-trust.md) for how each rung is decided.
