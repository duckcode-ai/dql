# 02 — Authoring blocks

**Who this is for:** analysts who'll author and certify reusable analytics
blocks on top of dbt models.

**What you'll do:** write a real block with governance metadata, agent
context, and tests, then walk it through the certification gate.

**Time:** 20 minutes.

> Setup: this tutorial continues from
> [01 — Getting started](./01-getting-started.md) — a `dql/` workspace inside
> a dbt repo, with the default connection pointed at the dbt warehouse. SQL
> below uses the example repo's `dev` schema; substitute your own models.

## The idea

dbt stops at modeled tables. The questions stakeholders actually ask —
"what's monthly revenue?", "what's our average order value?" — live in
ad-hoc queries, BI tiles, and pasted SQL. A **block** captures one answer as
code: the SQL, who owns it, what it means, how it's tested, and how an AI
agent should use it. Certified blocks become the only thing dashboards and
agents are allowed to trust.

---

## Step 1 — Open Block Studio

In the notebook UI:

1. Click **Blocks** in the activity bar.
2. Click **+ New** → **SQL Block** (you can also start from a dbt model —
   Block Studio lists them when dbt is synced).
3. Name it `revenue_by_month`. Domain: `revenue`. Hit **Create**.

> **You should see** a CodeMirror editor with a starter `.dql` template and
> tabs along the top: **Validate · Results · Save**.

The file lives at `blocks/revenue_by_month.dql`.

---

## Step 2 — Write the SQL + metadata

Replace the template with this block. We'll walk through each section
afterwards.

```dql
// blocks/revenue_by_month.dql
// dql-format: 1

block "revenue_by_month" {
  domain      = "revenue"
  type        = "custom"
  owner       = "you@your-company.com"
  description = "Gross revenue by calendar month, from the orders mart."
  tags        = ["revenue", "kpi", "monthly"]

  // ── Agent-facing metadata ────────────────────────────────────────────
  llmContext = """
    Use this block for questions about revenue over time, monthly revenue,
    or revenue trend. Revenue is the sum of order_total from the dbt
    orders mart — gross, before costs. One row per calendar month.
  """
  examples = [
    { question = "What is monthly revenue?" },
    { question = "How has revenue trended this year?" }
  ]
  invariants = ["revenue >= 0"]

  // ── Query ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  query = """
    SELECT
      date_trunc('month', ordered_at) AS month,
      SUM(order_total)                AS revenue
    FROM dev.orders
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1
  """

  visualization {
    chart = "line"
    x     = "month"
    y     = "revenue"
  }

  tests {
    assert row_count >= 1
    assert min(revenue) >= 0
  }
}
```

Hit **Cmd-S**. Block Studio auto-validates.

> **You should see** the **Validate** tab go green and the **Results** tab
> show one row per month.

### What each section is for

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `domain`, `owner`, `tags` | Routed into `dql-manifest.json` and the lineage graph. Required by the certifier. |
| `description` | Human-readable; shown in the Block Library and on dashboard tiles. |
| `llmContext` | One paragraph the agent uses to ground retrieval and SQL generation. **Required for good agent recall** — without it, the knowledge graph only has the description to work with. |
| `examples` | Few-shot questions the chat cell and Slack bot use to disambiguate. |
| `invariants` | Free-form post-conditions used as prompt grounding for the agent. |
| `query` | Your SQL. Triple-quoted so multi-line is comfortable. |
| `visualization` | Default chart for tiles that don't override it. |
| `tests` | Assertions run by `dql certify` against the real connection. |

---

## Step 3 — Run the certification gate

```bash
dql certify blocks/revenue_by_month.dql
```

(The default connection from `dql.config.json` is used automatically.)

> **You should see** the rule table — `has-description`, `has-owner`,
> `has-domain`, `tests-pass`, … — go green, ending with:
> ```text
> Status: certified
> ```

The block's `status` flips from `draft` → `certified`. Certification in OSS
is a **local trust label**: required metadata present, query executes,
test assertions pass.

---

## Step 4 — Confirm it landed in the manifest

```bash
dql compile
```

This rebuilds `dql-manifest.json` — the dbt-like artifact for the DQL
workspace. Your block appears under `blocks` with its status, domain, chart
type, and table dependencies (`dev.orders`).

---

## Step 5 — See it in the lineage graph

```bash
dql lineage --block revenue_by_month
```

> **You should see** the block reading from the orders model, which in turn
> traces back through the dbt DAG to its sources:
> ```text
> block:revenue_by_month (certified · revenue)
>   ↑ reads_from
> dbt model: orders → stg_orders → seed
> ```

Or click **Lineage** in the activity bar for the interactive graph.

---

## Step 6 — Add two more blocks for the next tutorial

Create and certify these the same way (Block Studio, or paste the files):

```dql
// blocks/avg_order_value.dql
// dql-format: 1

block "avg_order_value" {
  domain = "revenue"
  type = "custom"
  owner = "you@your-company.com"
  description = "Average order value across all orders, in dollars."
  tags = ["revenue", "kpi"]
  llmContext = "Single-value KPI: average order_total across all orders."
  query = """
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(order_total), 2) AS avg_order_value
    FROM dev.orders
  """
  visualization { chart = "single_value" }
  tests { assert row_count == 1 }
}
```

```dql
// blocks/daily_orders.dql
// dql-format: 1

block "daily_orders" {
  domain = "revenue"
  type = "custom"
  owner = "you@your-company.com"
  description = "Order count per day."
  tags = ["revenue", "volume"]
  llmContext = "Use for order volume over time: orders per day."
  query = """
    SELECT date_trunc('day', ordered_at) AS day,
           COUNT(*)                      AS orders
    FROM dev.orders
    GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1
  """
  visualization {
    chart = "bar"
    x = "day"
    y = "orders"
  }
  tests { assert row_count >= 1 }
}
```

```bash
dql certify blocks/avg_order_value.dql
dql certify blocks/daily_orders.dql
```

> **You should see** both flip to `certified` — three certified blocks,
> enough to compose a dashboard.

---

## What you now have

✓ A certified block with governance metadata, agent context, and tests
✓ A working understanding of every block-section field
✓ Three certified blocks ready to compose into a dashboard
✓ `dql-manifest.json` connecting your blocks to the dbt DAG
