# Compatibility

## Runtime

- **Node.js** — 20 or 22 LTS. Node 23 is not supported for native local drivers.
- **Package managers** — npm, pnpm, yarn all work for consuming published packages
- **OS** — macOS, Linux, Windows

## Connectors

DQL uses a flat install. Databricks SQL is built in; DuckDB/local files and
Snowflake install project-local driver packages into `.dql/connectors/`. See
[Connectors](./connectors.md).

## Chart types

`bar`, `line`, `scatter`, `donut`, `pie`, `area`, `heatmap`, `kpi`, `table`,
`histogram`, `grouped-bar`, `stacked-bar`, `waterfall`, `funnel`, `gauge`,
`geo`, `combo`, `boxplot`, `forecast`, `stacked-area`.

## Editor support

- **VS Code** — [`dql.dql-language-support`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dql.dql-language-support) extension (syntax, snippets, LSP)
- **Any LSP client** — `@duckcodeailabs/dql-lsp` speaks standard LSP
