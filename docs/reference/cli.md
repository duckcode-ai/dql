```bash
dql --help
dql --version
```

## Running the CLI

The command prefix depends on how DQL was installed:

| Installation | Command form | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project-local (recommended) | `npm exec -- dql <command>` | Any CLI command using the version in this repository |
| Project-local starter script | `npm run doctor`, `npm run notebook`, and similar | Common commands already declared in `package.json` |
| Project-local shorthand | `npx dql <command>` | Convenient when the local dependency is already installed |
| Global | `dql <command>` | A global installation available everywhere on `PATH` |

For example:

```bash
npm install
npm run doctor
npm exec -- dql model list
npm exec -- dql --help
```

`npm run` adds `node_modules/.bin` to `PATH` for that script. A normal shell
does not, so a bare `dql` command requires
`npm install -g @duckcodeailabs/dql-cli`. The command tables below use the
short global form for readability; prepend `npm exec --` for a project-local
installation.

## Commands

### Project

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `dql init [dir]` | Initialize DQL in a project (auto-detects dbt) |
| `dql doctor [path]` | Run local setup checks |
| `dql doctor scale` | Report enterprise-scale manifest/cache/index health |

| `dql validate [path]` | Validate all `.dql` files and semantic references |
| `dql compile [path]` | Generate project manifest (`dql-manifest.json`) |
| `dql verify [path]` | Verify that `dql-manifest.json` is reproducible from tracked source |

`dql doctor scale --format json` includes counts, cache freshness,
metadata/KG index state, context-pack timing, source fingerprints, domain
shards, and top rejected evidence candidates that were relevant but excluded by
retrieval caps.

`dql doctor git-hygiene --format json` checks tracked files against the OSS Git
policy and flags `.dql/cache`, `.dql/local`, `*.run.json`, `dql-manifest.json`,
local databases, data files, AI pins, saved views, and layout overrides.
