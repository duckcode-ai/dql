# Guides

Task-first, copy-runnable, with a concrete "verify it worked" step at the
end. If a guide doesn't work verbatim on a clean machine, it's a bug.

## Start here

- [Connect a warehouse](connect-warehouse.md) — Databricks, DuckDB/local files, and Snowflake

  your dbt repo, or the [example repo](https://github.com/duckcode-ai/jaffle-shop-duckdb))
